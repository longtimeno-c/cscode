### World Cup

To run the world cup file you need to enter the table name when running. You should update this to locate the file on your own operating system. I used this command:
```
/usr/local/bin/python3 "/Users/tristanhill/Documents/git/cscode/CS50/World Cup/tournament.py" "/Users/tristanhill/Documents/git/cscode/CS50/World Cup/2018m.csv"
```
